# Dola AI Video Watermark Remover & Downloader

A lightweight, powerful Google Chrome extension (Manifest V3) designed to automatically intercept and download **100% Watermark-Free 1080p Raw MP4 videos** in real-time from **Dola AI** and **Doubao**.

---

## Overview

When generating videos on Dola AI (`dola.com`) or Doubao (`doubao.com`), the platforms attach overlay watermarks and compress the default preview streams. 

**Dola AI Video Watermark Remover & Downloader** runs quietly in the background, intercepts the raw master video streams at the network layer, decrypts AES-CBC encrypted stream tokens, and downloads the original crystal-clear, unwatermarked 1080p MP4 file the second generation completes.

---

## Key Features

- **100% Watermark-Free Raw 1080p**: Automatically overrides stream parameters (`logo_type=unwatermarked`) and decrypts the master CDN stream token (`qAAB` decryption) to fetch original uncompressed videos.
- **Automatic Background Downloading**: Detects when a video finishes rendering and automatically saves it to your downloads directory without requiring manual clicks.
- **1-Click Screen Grabber**: On-demand download button in the extension popup to instantly capture and save any active video visible on your current tab.
- **Custom Subfolder Organization**: Specify a custom folder name (e.g., `Dola_Videos`) to keep your downloads neatly organized.
- **Download History & Quick Locate**: Keep track of recent downloads with one-click access to open the file location directly on your computer.
- **Privacy-Focused & Lightweight**: No external dependencies, no accounts required, no telemetry, and zero bloat. Pure native JavaScript.
